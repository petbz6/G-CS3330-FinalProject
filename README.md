## Layout:
1. Prompted to choose from 3 characters
2. Each character has a unique class that gives them strengths and weaknesses
3. Characters have specific strengths that will allow their abilities to critically hit an opponent with the respective weakness and vice-versa
4. After character selection, can choose quest (also check inventory for equipment/potions)
5. After quest selected, combat will occur and character will either win or lose based on their damage/equipment/health and that of the enemy
5. If the player character reaches a certain amount of health, they use a health potion that increases health by an amount, but removes potion from inventory
6. If the quest is successful, the player character will gain the equipment associated with the quest which will be added to their inventory.
